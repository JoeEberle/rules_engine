Welcome to the solution **Rules Engine** - an example for your projects

Automated rules engine for dynamically analyzing data quality.

 ## Pillasrs of Data Quality 
 1. **Completeness** - Ensures that all required data is present. 
  2. **Structural Integrity** - Ensures that the data adheres to the defined structure and format. 
  3. **Referential Integrity** - Ensures that data relationships are consistent and valid. 
  4. **Accuracy** - Ensures that data is correct and free from errors. 
  5. **Timeliness** - Ensures that data is up-to-date and available when needed. 
  6. **Consistency** - Ensures that data is uniform and consistent across different datasets and systems. 
  7. **Validity** - Ensures that data conforms to the defined rules and constraints. 
  8. **Uniqueness** - Ensures that each data element is unique and not duplicated.
