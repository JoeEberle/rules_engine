The **data quality rules engine** is designed to identify and reject datasets of poor quality by rigorously applying predefined validation rules and criteria. When data fails to meet standards for completeness, accuracy, integrity, or other quality dimensions, the engine flags these issues and rejects the dataset. This ensures that only data meeting quality thresholds is accepted for further use, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the overall system.

The **rules engine** systematically processes data sets to evaluate their overall quality by applying predefined rules and criteria. 

As it iterates through each record, the engine checks for **completeness** by ensuring all required fields are filled, and assesses **structural integrity** by verifying that the data adheres to the expected format and structure. 

It evaluates **referential integrity** by confirming that relationships between different data entities are consistent and valid. 

**Accuracy checks** involve validating the correctness of the data against trusted sources or benchmarks. 

The engine also ensures **timeliness** by checking that the data is current and relevant. 

**Consistency checks** are performed to ensure uniformity across various data sets and systems. 

**Validity rules** confirm that the data meets predefined constraints and standards, while **uniqueness checks** ensure there are no duplicate entries. By systematically applying these rules, the engine provides a comprehensive assessment of the data quality, identifying areas that require correction or improvement.
